Synopsis:

An automatic arc-line fitting routine.

Description:

Candidate arc lines are identified in the [arc_file] file by:

1.      Collapsing the frame along the spatial axis and finding peaks with the find_peaks function. 
        The [min_dist], [half_aperture_num_pix], [derivative_tol] and [derivative_tol_ref_px] 
        parameters have their usual meanings as stated in the spfind blurb.

2.      Checking the average pixel channel of the contiguous lines against the reference arc line
        list to identify matches. The maximum wavelength distance (in pixels) allowed for a peak to
        be associated with that from the reference arc line list is [max_pix_diff].

The routine will fail if either the number of contiguous lines found is less than 
[min_matched_lines]. 

A warning will be issued if it thinks the distribution of matched arc lines doesn't sample the 
wavelength range well, i.e. the average wavelength difference between the lines of the matched
line list does not lie within [max_av_wavelength_diff] of the average wavelength difference
between the lines of the reference arc list. It will also issue a warning if the chi squared
values indicate a suspect fit.

If successful, the program will produce a file [LOARCFIT_OUTPUTF_WAVFITS_FILE] containing the
fit parameters.

Example:

loarcfit arc_ext.fits 4 4 1 1 arc.lis 3 3 100 4
