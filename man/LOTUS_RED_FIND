Synopsis:

An automatic peak finding and centroiding routine for long-slit spectra.

Description:

The data is first binned along the dispersion axis (defined as x) with a bin size of [bin_size]
between the INTEGER limits [window_x_lo] and [window_x_hi]. For each bin, an initial estimate of 
the mean/sd is found using the [bg_percentile]th lowest valued pixels. This mean/sd is then used 
in an iterative sigma clip with sigma [clip_sigma] to filter out target flux and obtain a truer 
background mean/sd.

The derivatives for each bin are found, and a median filter of width [median_filter_width_px] 
pixels applied to smooth any erroneous data (e.g. cosmic rays, bad pixels). Bins containing 
target flux are then identified by searching for data values which are greater than the product 
of the background sigma and [min_SNR]. If [min_spatial_width_px] values satisfying this criteria 
exist, then the bin is flagged as usable.

To obtain a better centroid for the peak, the most positive derivative is found between the 
spatial limits [finding_window_lo_px] and [finding_window_hi_px] and consecutive 
pixels (up to a maximum of [max_centering_num_px] pixels) are traversed until the turnover point 
is found i.e. when the sign of the derivative changes. If no such turnover is found, the bin is
disregarded. This pixel and [centroid_half_window_size_px] pixels either side are then used to
find the sub-pixel centroid of the peak by applying a second order parabolic fit.
 
Finally, the program will error if the number of usable bins is < [min_used_bins]. Output is 
passed to the [LOFIND_OUTPUTF_PEAKS_FILE] file.
