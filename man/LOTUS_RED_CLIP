Synopsis:

An automatic clipping routine to extract the active region from a long-slit exposure.

Description:

The data is first binned along the dispersion axis (defined as x) with a bin size of [bin_size]. 
An initial estimate of the mean/sd is found using the [bg_percentile]th lowest
valued pixels. This mean/sd is then used in an iterative sigma clip with sigma [clip_sigma]
and a mean background level obtained. The mean of this background level is then compared with 
the mean frame level, and a warning is given if the two are found to be of a similar magnitude, 
i.e. 

 bg_mean + bg_sd*[thresh_sigma] >= frame_mean

Edges are found in the data by progressing through each side of the spatial axis and finding the
pixels with the maximum/minimum derivatives. These peaks are then further tested by ascertaining 
if a window of size [scan_window_size_px] consecutive pixels all have values lying above 
[scan_window_trig_nsigma] * the background level standard deviation. This is done for every bin 
along the dispersion axis.

Note that if the spectrum lies on the edge of the frame, this routine will return an incorrect
value. In this case, it is possible to explicitly override an edge value by specifying a value 
for [force_bottom_px] and/or [force_top_px]. These parameters should be set to -1 if they are not 
to be used.

Finally, the automatically deduced width is checked to be greater than [min_spectrum_width].

Example: 

loclip continuum.fits target.fits 20 0.1 1.0 3.0 100 1 100 target_tr.fits
